This plugin helps you organize your WordPress admin menu.

== Description ==

= This plugin helps you organize your WordPress admin menu. =

If your site has a bunch of custom post types, or many plugins with their own top-level menu, then the WP admin menu will quickly become overcrowded.

This plugin lets you hide menu items (e.g. Tools) entirely, or move them into the WP Admin Bar.
